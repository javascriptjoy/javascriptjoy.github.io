        <h2>My Future</h2>
            <h3>High School</h3>
            <p>
                Right now, I’m considering 2 different high schools: Millikan and Lakewood. I’m most likely going to Millikan because their academics are way better(I’m looking towards the QUEST program) and most of my friends are going there too. However, Lakewood is my homeschool and traveling there is much easier so the decision is pretty tough. Hopefully, I make it into Millikan!

            <h3>College</h3>
            <p>
                I really don’t know what I want to be when I grow up, so I haven’t looked towards any colleges. My parents want me to pursue either a mechanical or medical career, but I’m still not sure. I do know that I want to go to a good college like Harvard or Yale.

            <h3>Career Interests</h3>
            <p>
                I’m still not sure about my career interests. I’ve always enjoyed helping people, but I’m not sure about what I want to pursue. When I’m older, I’ll look into it more, but right now, I really want to focus on my grades in general.

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>
                I want to be successful in the future and be content with my life. All I ask for in the future is to be respected and looked up to. People looking down on me just makes me upset, so when I’m older, I want to be on top. I don’t want anyone to support me but myself and I hope I can help and repay my family and friends for taking care of me for so long.

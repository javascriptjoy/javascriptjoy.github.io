            <p>
                My school has a program called ATM which teaches students many different things about technology. Here are some of the things we learned previously.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <article>
            <p>The ATM program has opened me up to so many new experiences on the computer. I would’ve never learned how to type at the speed I’m typing at now. Being able to create posters and flyers with Photoshop and Illustrator was incredibly fun and constructing buildings with SketchUp and Floorplanner was so cool. Coding and creating websites is so impressive and it makes me feel so advanced while I’m making them.

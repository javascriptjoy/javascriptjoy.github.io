            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <p>
                I’ve played the piano for around 7 years and I am one of the captains of the girl’s basketball team. I enjoy basketball, but it’s not anything I want to continue in the future. I consider myself to be pretty good in school, but I’m horrible at algebra. At the moment, I’m mostly focusing on music because I really like to impress people and I’ve begun to learn Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, etc.

                Some of my hobbies include drawing and painting, but I still need a lot of improvement. Piano, once again, is still one of my favorite activities and I’ve started playing basketball for my school again. Me and a couple of friends have been in Girl Scouts for around 8 years and I participate in activities at church. I play a lot of horror games too like Little Nightmares, Outlast, FNAF 1-4, etc.

            <p>
                I live with my mom, my dad, and my younger sister. My mom and dad both grew up in Hawaii and they're very loving and supportive. My dad’s an engineer and my mom’s currently in school. My sister is slightly autistic but she’s doing great. My parents had me in 2004 and my sister was born in(I forgot).

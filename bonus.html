            <h3>Piano</h3>
            <p>I've played the piano for around 7 years and it's one of my favorite things to do. The music just makes me feel motivated to show off and impress people, as cocky as it seems. Just being able to play Mozart, Beethove, etc. gives me an unexplainable confidence that makes me so happy.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Here's a video of me playing piano for the 2016 talent show.</p>

        <p>Drawing and painting was always one of my favorite things to do as a kid. I wasn't very good, but I still practiced and practiced. Eventually, all those years led up and I was able to create some pieces that I was really, really proud of.</p>
            <br>
        <p> Here is one of the paintings I've finished recently.</p>
